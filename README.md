# EnergyEfficientFireDetector

In this project, we present a computer vision based novel method (we call it Big and Little, BnL) that can detect 
fires at their early stages. Our approach combines **traditional computer vision algorithms** (Little) and **deep 
learning models** (Big) that maintains accurate detection of fire while being fast & energy efficient (does not 
require much computing power). The advantages include saving costs with deployment in un-manned area, easily 
deployment on low cost computing devices like Raspberry Pi, etc.
